              <h4>Mr Phong Jaeger-Lecoultre </h4>
              <p> Mr. Nguyen Tuan Phong, "Jack of all Trades" is the term used to describe this man in all sorts of games. I am the proud owner
                of an air-cooled Porsche 911. Let's talk more about him. For me, he's no stranger at all. He's been a friend of mine since
                secondary school and still remains so to this day. Now, he's one of our beloved customers and a classic Porsche owner. He has many stories to tell when it comes
                to his Porsche and is always proud to own one of the timeless beauties of car culture, the 911. People said you could tell a person by
                their cars. Looking inside that car, you would never guess this guy was worth millions.

            <h4>Mr Phong's air-cooled 911 </h4>
            <p> Unlike today's modern water-cooled engines which are closed circuit and carry a liquid coolant through channels in the engine block and cylinder head, the air-cooled engine  released engine heat directly into the air.
                So we 'PLP Porsche' are proud to be the exclusive seller of Mr. Phong's 911 and we are honored to be his trusted Porsche Dealer Ship to be picked

            <h4>Mr Phong's air-cooled 911 </h4>
            <p> His second purchase was a lovely maroon-red air-cooled Porsche. Still, this iconic design urges him to buy a second one. Right after the first one he bought, he went straight home, called us, and we, PLP Porsche, immediately ordered it for him as soon as possible. We must inspect every corner, paint, and seat stitching; even minor mistakes will not be tolerated.
                PLP Porsche delivered the best car for the best customer, and Mr. Phong is no exception.

            <h4> A 4 doors 911 </h4>
            <p>I myself am a BMW fan. But Porsche has a special place in my heart as well. The Porsche Panamera is the car that made me fall in love
                with Porsche. The first generation might not be the best looking, but it starts with this iconic design that makes people could not mistake this for something else
                . Right after I delivered Mr. Phong's air-cooled 911, I immediately imported for myself a Majestic Mamba green Panamera. Right at that moment, I officially became a Porsche owner.
